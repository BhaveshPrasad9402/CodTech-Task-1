EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining a dataset to understand its main characteristics and relationships, typically through statistical summaries and visualizations.
### Load Data: Use pandas to import the dataset and check its structure (.info(), .describe(), .head()).
### Handle Missing Data: Identify missing values (.isnull().sum()) and decide how to address them (drop or impute).
### Analyze Distributions: Use histograms or box plots to examine numerical data and detect outliers.
### Explore Relationships: Correlation matrix with heatmaps (sns.heatmap()). Scatter plots or pair plots (sns.scatterplot(), sns.pairplot()).
### Categorical Analysis: Use bar plots and box plots to analyze categorical variables and their impact on numerical data.
### Outliers: Detect with box plots or statistical methods.
